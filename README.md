# Nike App
A fullstack project where I create a Nike app clone. 

# NikeFrontend
Ever wondered what a clone of the Nike app would like? Me neither. Check it out here anyway under the 'ui' branch. Uses React Native and Redux Toolkit Query.

# NikeBackend
Ever wondered what the backend logic of the Nike app looks like? Now you do. Check it out under the 'main' branch. Featuring API logic made with Node.JS and MongoDB

# Nike App
A fullstack project where I create a clone of a very popular running shoe's app. 

## NikeFrontend
Ever wondered what the frontend of a Nike app would look like? Me neither. Check it out here anyway under the 'ui' branch. Uses React Native and Redux Toolkit Query.

## NikeBackend
Ever wondered what the backend logic of the Nike app looks like? Now you do. Check it out under the 'main' branch. Features API logic made with Node.JS that interfaces with MongoDB.

# Nike App
A fullstack project of the Nike app.

## NikeFrontend
Ever wondered what the frontend of a Nike app would look like? Me neither. Check it out here anyway under the 'ui' branch. Uses React Native and Redux.

## NikeBackend
Ever wondered what the backend logic of the Nike app looks like? Me neither. Check it out under the 'main' branch. Features API logic made with Node.JS that interfaces with MongoDB.
